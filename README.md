Implemented a CLEAN style approach without Mediator and CQRS patterns.

# TODOs:
Finish implementation of Redis caching which I started. I needed to add the results to cache, set the expiry time
Create endpoint to query conversion from and to currency with set amount input and converted amount returned
Insert currency rates into mysql table although was on the path
Write Unit tests

# Developer Comments
Sadly my health has played a major part in not delivering my best, I am very disappointed.

I have all the implementations and strategies I would of applied so I guess time was not on my side although an extention my body gave up and let me down.

Be it as it may thanks for taking the time to view my code
